# Autocorrector-Feature-Using-NLP-In-Python


- **DESCRIPTION -** The goal of this project was to develop an autoencoder feature using NLP techniques in Python. The autoencoder will analyze input text, identify misspelled words, and suggest or replace them with the correct ones. 
Autocorrect is a way of predicting and making the wrong spellings correct, which helps in making tasks like writing paragraphs, reports and srticles easier.



- **TOOLS AND LIBRARIES -**
  1. **PYTHON -** Programming language for implementing the project.
  2. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) -** NLTK library is used for NLP - related tasks and fuctionalities.
  3. **re -** library used to match text based on pre-defined patterns.
  4. **pattern -** library used to do lemmatization
 


- **MODEL DESCRIPTION -** The code can be divided into 5 main parts, that helps in the creation of different possible words. The steps are:
  1. Lemmatization
  2. Deletion of letters
  3. Switching letters
  4. Replacing letters
  5. Inserting new letters
